This is a repository for practicing work with Ceedling, a build system intended
for TDD on embedded devices. The project is simply having a DHT20 temp/humi
sensor print out temp/humi values once per second. The project is split into
different layers: app, bsp, driver, and hal for ease of testing while also
promoting modularity.

This repository was built using Docker. Please see the embedded-tdd-docker
repository.
